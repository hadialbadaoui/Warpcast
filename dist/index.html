    <h2>My New Game: Guess What? 🔐</h2>
    <p>You have <strong>20 seconds</strong> to guess the correct <strong>4-digit code</strong>.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>If all 4 numbers are correct, the door opens, you score 10 points, and advance.</li>
      <li>If any number is wrong, incorrect digits turn red as hints. The door stays locked and the game ends.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><em>Fast, smart, and focused? Prove it. Your mind is the key.</em></p>

    <h2>About "By Order"</h2>
    <p>
      Select five numbers in ascending order inside circles within 10 seconds.
	  A fast-paced game to sharpen reflexes and IQ by training quick numerical sequence recognition.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pro tip: Pick the two smallest numbers within 3 seconds, next two in 2 seconds, then reset focus before submitting.
    </p>
    <p>
      “By Order” is more than a game — it’s a mental workout. Challenge yourself and others.
    </p>
    <strong>Game on! Test your focus, beat the clock, and level up.</strong></p>
